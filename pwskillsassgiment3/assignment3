3.Why did javascript and Ecmascript come to the picture?
->Before JavaScript was developed, web pages were static and could not be
changed by the user. If a web page needed to display dynamic content or

This made the web a less interactive and responsive experience for users.

->JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995. It was developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997.Initially known as LiveScript, Netscape changed the name to JavaScript so they could position it as a companion for the Java language, a product of their partner, Sun Microsystems.Its earliest releases suffered from notable performance and security issues, but developers had no alternatives.
